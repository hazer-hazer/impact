# Name resolution

## Definition collection

Name resolution starts with the definition collection stage, where module tree is built from AST defining each item in module (?) it relates too.

> Here, module is not only a `mod` item but something broader by the meaning


## Type alias expansion

Each type alias inner type will be replaced 



## Built-ins

Compiler is aware of some set of built-ins, there's a function to declare (only declare!) a built-in value (including functions).
So, to declare a built-in with name `name` you write `name = builtin`.
`builtin` is a real definition in the compiler.
